## Notes
For this assignment, I used d3 and added some animation effects to form a smooth change of colors and data. I use the button button to be the trigger of the change. In some changes, the axis and color and position will be changed. 


## Included files

* a05.js - run file
* calvinScores.js - data file
* buttons.js - data file
* index.html - show file
* README.md - this file
* d3.js - function file


## References
I added additional content. I created a new file for the user to switch back and forth between SATV and SATV+SATM. This button will change the value of axis-x. It will also change the position of the circle.
